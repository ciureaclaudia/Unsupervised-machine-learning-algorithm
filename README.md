# Unsupervised-machine-learning-algorithm-Clustering

The aim of the project is to analyze the flow of Passenger Traffic Statistics by Airline in San Francisco International Airport. To do so, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm was chosen to group operating airlines into clusters with similar traits to see the pattern of traffic passenger statistics based on time of the year, how long is the flight, price of the flight. 
Clustering is a technique that groups similar data points such that the points in the same group are more like each other than the points in the other groups. The group of similar data points is called a Cluster.


The dataset was taken from the website data.World: https://data.world/data-society/air-traffic-passenger-data 
There are 15,007 rows, 16 columns. The data includes the number of passengers, the operating airline, the published airline, the geographic region, the activity type code, the price category code, the terminal, the boarding area, and the year and month of the flight

In order to find the best clustering algorithm for the dataset and propose the optimal clustering number, multiple algorithms were used: K means and Hierarchical clustering.
